/**
 * Component that initiates leader election based on holding a lock. If the lock has the
 * right properties (global with expiry), there will never be more than one leader, but
 * there may occasionally be no leader for short periods. If the lock has stronger
 * guarantees, and it interrupts the holder's thread when it expires or is stolen, then
 * you can adjust the parameters to reduce the leaderless period to be limited only by
 * latency to the lock provider. The election process ties up a thread perpetually while
 * we hold and try to acquire the lock, so a native leader initiator (not based on a lock)
 * is likely to be more efficient. If there is no native leader initiator available, but
 * there is a lock registry (e.g. on a shared database), this implementation is likely to
 * be useful.
